paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.sZ86mbX8D5PfYuhl]{Oath of Devotion}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"SRD 5.1","identifier":"paladin","levels":3,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"z2d0fxi8e24gradq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"Jctggx18lYjMI3AS":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","zURdGQJuxBNm9wYZ":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"}},"level":1,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"xy3wlxtiwbplsms7","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.Ho7dVxBlOYFlfBHk","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"QK7j8kSMN3RIBfFm":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.Ho7dVxBlOYFlfBHk","ssDGuFiSGvfRufAB":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","uwitGFcvg9DTH4yi":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"}},"level":2,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"v26vmuy5lpsu5g4c","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.8M7uOPhbTxoxxJSo"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"5mL78XTdxMS81Zdt":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","PyheTuzZYKZbFIp8":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC","EP0W0f7dxtdujKoo":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.8M7uOPhbTxoxxJSo"}},"level":3,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"m3ytemj4ygib8c5m","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":5,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"w3n62vbfeo3c7a90","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":6,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"ers71klsl2dcjpfa","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":10,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"kxodggik4e56u85t","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":11,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"3x1u7nnxv8ftkt0d","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":14,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"ebo3padd7vg4jg3g","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":"avg","3":"avg"},"title":""}],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"cha"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":100000,"ownership":{"default":0,"EkBjaHUIGZ1pQeoq":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.gZiUvbXWLs0pOp0c"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1661787234280,"modifiedTime":1676204312437,"lastModifiedBy":"EkBjaHUIGZ1pQeoq"}},{"_id":"Jctggx18lYjMI3AS","name":"Divine Sense","ownership":{"default":0,"EkBjaHUIGZ1pQeoq":3},"type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.

Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.</p>\n<p>Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.</p>\n<p>Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.</p>\n<h3>Druids and the Gods</h3>\n<p>Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in <a class=\"content-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.rules\" data-id=\"2JNtWRo7wMq08bXn\"> appendix PH-B</a> include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples.</p>\n<h1>Druid Circles</h1>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.4Ae2SPZRXEVbVs0M]{Circle of the Land}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"druid","levels":5,"hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"6pdotglp4hy4zlvb","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.LzJ5ayHt0OlSVGxi","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.i6tPm3FNK13Ftc9v"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"lLyOr0rT9EuA8SrQ":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.LzJ5ayHt0OlSVGxi","Ebh7oy70p0WLUzzV":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.i6tPm3FNK13Ftc9v"}},"level":1,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"qnfy6m18u4cfdqwm","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.swK0r5TOIxredxWS","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.u6Du2P9s81SWuGbi"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"ez8Zw2raiyrCYOy4":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.swK0r5TOIxredxWS","gVix8rJwBw195zfy":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.u6Du2P9s81SWuGbi"}},"level":2,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"r3xhzsz7noff50w3","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.cVDEQo0ow1WJT7Wl","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.xvgPu1O57DgXCM86"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":18,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"pkfb1a2u37665epq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ip4bvmGoz3qkoqes"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":20,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"qv0gbr1rb5889ubd","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":"avg","3":"avg","4":"avg","5":"avg"},"title":""},{"_id":"6vytnom37pkazgld","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"wild-shape","type":"number","scale":{"2":{"value":0.25},"4":{"value":0.5},"8":{"value":1}},"distance":{"units":""}},"value":{},"title":"Wild Shape CR"}],"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","ani","ins","med","nat","prc","rel","sur"],"value":["med","prc"]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"wis"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"fMheUOSnfrkayucp":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.ygVYgPbJkaH0tH1N"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1661787234284,"modifiedTime":1676735828031,"lastModifiedBy":"7mhi0vaNvNxngVoX"}},{"name":"Circle of the Depths","type":"subclass","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/cave-entrance-mountain-blue.webp","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>From the highest mountain peaks, to ancient forest groves, to blistering deserts, Circles of Druids can be found in every environment.

druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.</p>\n<p>Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.</p>\n<p>Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.</p>\n<h3>Druids and the Gods</h3>\n<p>Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in <a class=\"content-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.rules\" data-id=\"2JNtWRo7wMq08bXn\"> appendix PH-B</a> include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples.</p>\n<h1>Druid Circles</h1>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.4Ae2SPZRXEVbVs0M]{Circle of the Land}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"druid","levels":5,"hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"6pdotglp4hy4zlvb","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.LzJ5ayHt0OlSVGxi","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.i6tPm3FNK13Ftc9v"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"lLyOr0rT9EuA8SrQ":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.LzJ5ayHt0OlSVGxi","Ebh7oy70p0WLUzzV":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.i6tPm3FNK13Ftc9v"}},"level":1,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"qnfy6m18u4cfdqwm","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.swK0r5TOIxredxWS","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.u6Du2P9s81SWuGbi"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"ez8Zw2raiyrCYOy4":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.swK0r5TOIxredxWS","gVix8rJwBw195zfy":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.u6Du2P9s81SWuGbi"}},"level":2,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"r3xhzsz7noff50w3","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.cVDEQo0ow1WJT7Wl","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.xvgPu1O57DgXCM86"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":18,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"pkfb1a2u37665epq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ip4bvmGoz3qkoqes"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":20,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"qv0gbr1rb5889ubd","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":"avg","3":"avg","4":"avg","5":"avg"},"title":""},{"_id":"6vytnom37pkazgld","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"wild-shape","type":"number","scale":{"2":{"value":0.25},"4":{"value":0.5},"8":{"value":1}},"distance":{"units":""}},"value":{},"title":"Wild Shape CR"}],"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","ani","ins","med","nat","prc","rel","sur"],"value":["med","prc"]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"wis"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"fMheUOSnfrkayucp":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.ygVYgPbJkaH0tH1N"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1661787234284,"modifiedTime":1676735828031,"lastModifiedBy":"7mhi0vaNvNxngVoX"}},{"name":"Circle of the Depths","type":"subclass","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/cave-entrance-mountain-blue.webp","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>From the highest mountain peaks, to ancient forest groves, to blistering deserts, Circles of Druids can be found in every environment.

While your echo is being used in this way, it can be up to 1,000 feet away from you without being destroyed.</p><h3 id=\"toc3\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;font-family:inherit;font-weight:500;line-height:1.1;color:inherit;margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:10px;font-size:24px\"><span style=\"box-sizing:border-box\"><span style=\"font-family:inherit\"><strong>Shadow Martyr</strong></span></span></h3><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;margin:0px 0px 10px\">Starting at 10th level, you can make your echo throw itself in front of an attack directed at another creature that you can see. Before the attack roll is made, you can use your reaction to teleport the echo to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the targeted creature. The attack roll that triggered the reaction is instead made against your echo.</p><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;margin:0px 0px 10px\">Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3 id=\"toc4\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;font-family:inherit;font-weight:500;line-height:1.1;color:inherit;margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:10px;font-size:24px\"><span style=\"box-sizing:border-box\"><span style=\"font-family:inherit\"><strong>Reclaim Potential</strong></span></span></h3><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;margin:0px 0px 10px\">By 15th level, you've learned to absorb the fleeting magic of your echo. When an echo of yours is destroyed by taking damage, you can gain a number of temporary hit points equal to 2d6 + your Constitution modifier, provided you don't already have temporary hit points.</p><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;margin:0px 0px 10px\">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h3 id=\"toc5\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;font-family:inherit;font-weight:500;line-height:1.1;color:inherit;margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:10px;font-size:24px\"><span style=\"box-sizing:border-box\"><span style=\"font-family:inherit\"><strong>Legion of One</strong></span></span></h3><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;margin:0px 0px 10px\">At 18th level, you can use a bonus action to create two echos with your Manifest Echo feature, and these echoes can co-exist. If you try to create a third echo, the previous two echoes are destroyed. Anything you can do from one echo's position can be done from the other's instead.</p><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;margin:0px 0px 10px\">In addition, when you roll initiative and have no uses of your Unleash Incarnation feature left, you regain one use of that feature.</p></div></div></div></div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"","subtype":""},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"_id":"wgK5xzCjvLRPiuet","img":"https://i.ibb.co/DWFVxGW/05-MT004-full.png","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":200000,"ownership":{"default":0,"MrafPVZNcALgQS2R":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680098754614,"modifiedTime":1680109573984,"lastModifiedBy":"MrafPVZNcALgQS2R"}},{"name":"Athlete","type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Athlete</p><p>Source:

You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list.

Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<h5>Ritual Casting</h5>\n<p>You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\n<h5>Spellcasting Focus</h5>\n<p>You can use a holy symbol (see @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.BYFd9hiJGo9L5aOM.JournalEntryPage.AjavRU4yPfI9hfaI]{Adventuring Gear}) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"SRD 5.1","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"class","subtype":""},"requirements":"Cleric 1","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{"dnd5e":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.v4gKwLhAq9vuqza7","advancementOrigin":"QeM1vMVgsevlqlgo.x1zumbrnbhqlrrs6"}},"img":"icons/magic/life/ankh-gold-blue.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":1200000,"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1661787234436,"modifiedTime":1680098682399,"lastModifiedBy":"tvIJ4COrZMXtfW0p"}},{"_id":"sJ36sejObVP1W4MT","name":"Divine Domain","ownership":{"default":0,"tvIJ4COrZMXtfW0p":3},"type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Choose one domain related to your deity, such as Life.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.sZ86mbX8D5PfYuhl]{Oath of Devotion}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"SRD 5.1","identifier":"paladin","levels":5,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"z2d0fxi8e24gradq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"ycPXJP391qB5QsmS":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","fWTHnPw27ZCyS1en":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"}},"level":1,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"xy3wlxtiwbplsms7","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.Ho7dVxBlOYFlfBHk","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"ZFdQtejIwsLasDMK":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.Ho7dVxBlOYFlfBHk","HFHsRkQpYYOR4Bim":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","TZaquLKBwMFL15nc":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"}},"level":2,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"v26vmuy5lpsu5g4c","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.8M7uOPhbTxoxxJSo"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"UdJTf1MgkEL7LHa2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","ccSOcyZ045jBCwVG":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC","Up9Aj9LgfsAkdixe":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.8M7uOPhbTxoxxJSo"}},"level":3,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"m3ytemj4ygib8c5m","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"NgCgx9RAMdTWhTcu":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"}},"level":5,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"w3n62vbfeo3c7a90","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":6,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"ers71klsl2dcjpfa","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":10,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"kxodggik4e56u85t","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":11,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"3x1u7nnxv8ftkt0d","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":14,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"ebo3padd7vg4jg3g","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":"avg","3":"avg","4":"avg","5":"avg"},"title":""}],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"cha"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":100000,"ownership":{"default":0,"JKUw51QHOO22tIOW":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.gZiUvbXWLs0pOp0c"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1661787234280,"modifiedTime":1680113221859,"lastModifiedBy":"JKUw51QHOO22tIOW"}},{"_id":"ycPXJP391qB5QsmS","name":"Divine Sense","ownership":{"default":0,"JKUw51QHOO22tIOW":3},"type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.
